# Css flex box

Exercise to practice the flexbox in CSS <br/>
This Project only has one master branch, it was a small project so it did not need more branches

## Things I was learning:

-Add flex superpowers to the tweet embed <br/>
*Flex the position of two boxes <br/>
-Flex-direction property to make a row <br/>
-Align Elements Using the justify-content Property: flex-end <br>


## Builded with 🛠️

**HTML 5** and **CSS3**
